# HSKY
Code Repository for Northeastern University's VEXU team: HSKY. We are affiliated with the [Northeastern Robotics Club](https://web.northeastern.edu/nurobotics/)

## Getting Setup
We program using [PROS for V5](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/), an extension of C++ for development on the V5 Electronics system. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and navigate to the extensions tab and search for the PROS [VScode Extension](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros-vsc).
