# ITZ
This project is a simulation of the VEX EDR game In The Zone (2017-2018). 

Programmer Notes
The physics built into this game is entirely nonexistent. There is no friction, no forces, no velocities, no acceleration.
The robot has a maximum safe speed of 1140 inches / second. Anything above that will allow the robot to exit the field perimeter.
